# üìù Description <a name = "description"></a>

The legal system in India relies heavily on the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to define and punish criminal offenses. Creating a comprehensive and accessible dataset of IPC sections is crucial for legal practitioners, researchers, and the general public. Developed a dataset with three essential columns - Section ID, Description in simple words, and Punishment. The dataset covers a diverse range of IPC sections to provide a nuanced understanding of the legal landscape.

# üí° Approach <a name = "approach"></a>
The Multi-Lingual Legal Information Retrieval System is designed to facilitate efficient access to legal datasets in English, Hindi, and Marathi. Leveraging Flask for web development and Pandas for data manipulation, the system allows users to input keywords or sentences in their preferred language. The backend employs language-specific datasets for English, Hindi, and Marathi, filtering relevant legal information based on user input. The system supports transliteration from English to Devanagari script for Hindi and Marathi languages. The frontend, implemented using HTML and styled with CSS, ensures an intuitive user experience. Results are presented in a visually appealing format, offering a seamless transition from content input to comprehensive legal information retrieval.
